1. Ensure you have permissions to execute the program files:

	chmod +x ftserver.c ftclient.py makefile

2. Run the makefile and compile chatclient.c into something you can execute: 

	make

3. Spin up the server with whatever port number you'd like to test on:

	ftserver [PORTNUM]

   Example: 

	ftserver 45600 


4. Spin up the client with the server's hostname, control port, command, filename (if using command -g) and data port:
	
	python3 ftclient.py [SERVERHOSTNAME] [PORTNUM] [COMMAND] [FILENAME] [DATAPORTNUM]	*if using -g command
				
		-or-

	python3 ftclient.py [SERVERHOSTNAME] [PORTNUM] [COMMAND] [DATAPORTNUM]			*if using -l command

  Examples:

	python3 ftclient.py flip1 45600 -l 45599

	python3 ftclient.py flip1 45600 -g mytestfile.txt 45599

NOTES:
	- All testing occurred with server spun up on flip1 and client on flip2
	- Client will disconnect after each request is completed.
	- Server must receive a SIGINT (ctrl + c) to exit.	

EXTRA CREDIT:
	- Binary files can also be transfered via -g command. Be sure to include .bin file extension in filename.

  Example:	
	
	python3 ftclient.py flip1 45600 -g bios.bin 45599
